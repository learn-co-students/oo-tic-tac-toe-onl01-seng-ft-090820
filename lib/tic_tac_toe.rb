    #Define a method into which we can pass user input (in the form of a string, e.g., "1", "5", etc.) and have it return to us the corresponding index of the @board array. Remember that, from the player's point of view, the board contains spaces 1-9. But the indices in an array start their count at 0. If the user inputs 5, your method must correctly translate that from the player's perspective to the array's â€” accounting for the fact that @board[5] is not where the user intended to place their token.

    def input_to_index(input)

        #the input is the spot on the board they want
        #change their string to an integer
        i = input.to_i - 1
        return i
        #change their integer to the position they really mean (-1)

    end

    #move

    #Your #move method must take in two arguments: the index in the @board array that the player chooses and the player's token (either "X" or "O"). The second argument, the player's token, should default to "X".

    def move(i, token = "X")

        #set the position of the board at the index of their choice (i) equal to token
        @board[i] = token

    end

    def position_taken?(i)

        if @board[i] == " "
            return false
        else
            return true
        end

        #if the board index (i) is empty, FALSE
        #if it's not, TRUE

    end

    def valid_move?(i)

        if i.between?(0,8) == false
            return false

            return false
        else 
            return true

        #if it's position_taken?, FALSE
        #otherwise, TRUE

    #turn
    #Build a method #turn to encapsulate the logic of a single complete turn composed of the following routine:

    #Ask the user for their move by specifying a position between 1-9.
    #Receive the user's input.
    #Translate that input into an index value.
    #If the move is valid, make the move and display the board.
    #If the move is invalid, ask for a new move until a valid move is received.
    #All these procedures will be wrapped into our #turn method. However, the majority of the logic for these procedures will be defined and encapsulated in individual methods that you've already built.

    #You can imagine the pseudocode for the #turn method:

    #ask for input
    #get input
    #translate input into index
    #if index is valid
    #make the move for index
    #show the board
    #else
    #ask for input again
